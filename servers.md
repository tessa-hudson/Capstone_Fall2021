## Starting the Servers
- To start the backend server, run the startup script by entering `./startBackendDev.sh`
  - You may need to give the script permission to run by entering the command `chmod +x startBackendDev.sh`

- To start the front end run the startup script by entering `./startReactDev.sh`
  - This script may also need permission to run
 
 
 These scripts contain secrets and important enviroment variables needed for the servers to run. Contact Tyler Blair (trblair@crimson.ua.edu) to recieve a copy of the scripts.
