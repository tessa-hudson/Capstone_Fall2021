# Score Tracker for Camp Clot Not

## Motivation
Camp Clot Not is a camp hosted by HBDA that allows children ranging from 6-18 years old who suffer from various bleeding disorders to enjoy a camp experience they normally would not be able to enjoy.

During the camp, counselors hold activities for the children and keep track of scores over the week to announce at the end of the camp what the teams earned, while also maintaining the correct amount of supervision for the kids needs and safety.
With an application to assist them, we hope we can allow these counselors an easy and intuitive way to keep track of scoring so they can focus on the needs and enjoyment of the children at the camp.​

## Core Features
- An easy-to-read leaderboard
- A secure login system for camp counselors and administrators
- Point addition and subtraction requests available to authorized users
